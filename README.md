# CNN_project
## Name: Emily Zhu
## Final Commit: a5a69b0
## Description: Using images to classify flowers into 102 types
### Note: I couldn't add the original dataset here because the file was too big to be pushed to Git even when compressed to a tar.gz file.
### I also had some issues with committing and pushing so my intermediate commits are gone. 
### I also have another repository called CNNproject which is empty. This is the one with my project in it. Sorry for the confusion
